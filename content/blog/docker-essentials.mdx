# Docker Essentials Cheat Sheet

A concise reference for Docker commands and concepts I frequently use.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Image** | A read-only template with instructions for creating a container |
| **Container** | A runnable instance of an image |
| **Volume** | Persistent data storage for containers |
| **Network** | Communication channel between containers |

## Common Commands

### Container Management

```bash
# Run a container
docker run -d --name my-app -p 3000:3000 my-image

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop and remove
docker stop my-app
docker rm my-app

# View logs
docker logs -f my-app
```

### Image Management

```bash
# Build an image
docker build -t my-app:latest .

# List images
docker images

# Remove an image
docker rmi my-app:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

## Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds help create smaller production images:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Architecture Overview

You can include architecture or flow diagrams directly in your blog posts using standard markdown image syntax:

```markdown
![Description of the diagram](/blog/your-diagram.png)
```

Place your images in `public/blog/` and reference them with `/blog/filename`. They will render full-width with captions automatically.

## Tips

- Always use `.dockerignore` to exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, etc.
- Use specific image tags instead of `latest` in production
- Leverage layer caching by copying `package.json` before source code
- Use health checks in production containers
