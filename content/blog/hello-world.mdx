# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I created this blog to share my study notes, learning experiences, and technical insights as a software developer.

## Why I Started This Blog

As a developer, I believe in continuous learning and knowledge sharing. This blog serves as:

- A personal knowledge base for my study notes
- A way to document my learning journey
- A resource for other developers who might find my notes helpful

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about topics like:

- **Backend Development** — NestJS, Hono, API design patterns
- **AI & Machine Learning** — RAG pipelines, LangChain, vector databases
- **Cloud & DevOps** — AWS, Docker, Terraform, CI/CD
- **Web Development** — React, Next.js, TypeScript

## Code Example

Here's a simple TypeScript example to get started:

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string): string => {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
};

console.log(greeting("World"));
```
