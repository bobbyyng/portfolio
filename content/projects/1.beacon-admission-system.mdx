# Project Background

Beacon is a tutorial school that offers a variety of courses to students. Our company developed a system to help their staff manage business operations, including course scheduling, student information, teacher information, enrolment, invoices, and notes.

The core system is built with Yii2. Additionally, a student portal—developed in Laravel—allows students to log in to view their schedules and manage enrollment actions such as purchasing courses, making up classes, or changing classes. This portal communicates with the main admission system via an API to process and handle requests.

# My Responsibilities

- Handle daily client requests and requirements
- Immediately investigate and fix bugs reported by clients
- Develop new features based on client requirements
- Collaborate with the team to integrate the Laravel student portal with the main system

# Key Contributions

- **Notes Reservation Feature**

  - Developed a listing in the Admission System to display which students have reserved which notes. This allowed administrators to track reservations, fulfill shipments, update statuses, reject requests, or enter waybill numbers to automatically send notification emails to students.
  - Implemented APIs for the portal, enabling it to retrieve the relevant notes for each enrolled course and to handle the entire notes reservation workflow.

- **Viso Points System**
  - Developed the Viso points system, allowing users to purchase points in advance. These points can be used as currency within the system to buy courses or other items, but they have an expiration date.
  - Implemented the complete workflow for Viso point purchases, including dealing with point expiry.
  - Added a new payment method to enable users to pay using Viso points, including logic to determine which Viso points to deduct, when to deduct them, and ensuring accurate calculation of point balances.
  - Created custom reports using SQL to support business analysis of the Viso points system.
