# Project Background

Kids Gallery is an educational institution that provides various courses and programs for children. Our company developed an admission system to help their staff manage daily business operations, including course scheduling, student information management, teacher assignments, enrollment processing, invoice generation, and learning materials management.

The core system is built with Yii2 framework, providing a robust backend for administrative operations. Similar to the Beacon system, we also developed a student portal using Laravel that allows parents and students to log in, view schedules, manage enrollments, and handle course-related actions. The portal communicates with the main admission system through RESTful APIs to ensure seamless data synchronization and real-time updates.

# My Responsibilities

- Handle daily client requests and requirements for Kids Gallery
- Immediately investigate and fix bugs reported by clients to ensure system stability
- Develop new features based on client's specific business needs
- Collaborate with the team to integrate the Laravel student portal with the main Yii2 system
- Maintain and optimize the existing codebase to improve performance and user experience

# Key Contributions

- **System Adaptation and Customization**
  - Adapted the existing admission system framework (similar to Beacon) to meet Kids Gallery's specific operational requirements. While the core architecture remained consistent, I customized various modules to align with their unique business processes and workflows.
  - Implemented company-specific features and business rules that differentiate Kids Gallery's system from other clients while maintaining code reusability and system maintainability.

- **Student Portal Integration**
  - Developed and maintained RESTful APIs that enable seamless communication between the Laravel student portal and the Yii2 backend system.
  - Implemented secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and system security.
  - Created APIs for course enrollment, schedule viewing, class transfers, and other student-facing functionalities.

- **Enrollment and Course Management**
  - Enhanced the enrollment workflow to support Kids Gallery's specific course structure and scheduling requirements.
  - Implemented features for managing course capacity, waitlist handling, and automatic enrollment confirmations.
  - Developed reporting tools to help administrators track enrollment trends and course popularity.

- **Invoice and Payment Processing**
  - Customized the invoice generation system to match Kids Gallery's billing requirements and payment terms.
  - Implemented payment tracking and reconciliation features to ensure accurate financial records.
  - Created automated reminders for outstanding payments and payment confirmation workflows.

- **Learning Materials Management**
  - Developed a system to track and manage learning materials distribution to students.
  - Implemented inventory management features to ensure adequate stock levels for course materials.
  - Created workflows for material reservations and distribution tracking.
