# Project Background

A client company migrated their ERP system to Microsoft D365 but faced a shortage of in-house IT resources. I was brought in as a professional developer to lead the design and implementation of business reports using D365 and SSRS, ensuring all departments had the critical data insights required for efficient operations.

# My Responsibilities

- Rapidly ramped up on the D365 data model and internal tooling to proficiently design and build custom SSRS reports tailored for diverse operational needs.
- Independently created report layouts, optimizing format and data presentation to ensure key insights are immediately clear to business users from different departments.
- Proactively engaged with stakeholders across finance, HR, and operations to analyze and document detailed reporting requirements, translating them into robust technical logic.
- Analyzed existing D365 data, planned and standardized data sources, fields, and display logic to guarantee report accuracy and user-friendly interpretation.
- Addressed technical challenges during report development—including D365 platform constraints and SSRS tool limitations—delivering effective solutions and high-quality deliverables.

# Key Contributions

- **Mastered D365 Structure and Report Development**
  - Quickly developed deep understanding of the D365 database schema and business process workflows to enable precise data extraction and report parameterization.
  - Efficiently utilized D365 reporting tools (such as Visual Studio SSRS development suite) and managed the end-to-end deployment pipeline for production-ready reports.

- **Report Layout Design and Stakeholder Communication**
  - Designed customized report templates based on the actual application scenarios of accounting, HR, and operations departments.
  - Led requirement-gathering interviews and iterative feedback sessions with business units, driving ongoing optimization of report content and usability.

- **Facilitated Cross-Department Collaboration**
  - Identified pain points in departmental operations and worked closely with end-users to refine and clarify report requirements.
  - Maintained transparent communication with leadership to align on development progress, explain technical decisions and constraints, and ensure mutual understanding.
