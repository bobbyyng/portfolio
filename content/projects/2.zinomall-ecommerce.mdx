# Project Background

[zinomall.com](https://zinomall.com) is an online store selling its own health supplements. The site was built before I joined the company. The team chose WordPress with WooCommerce to create a customized e-commerce platform, providing all the standard features expected from an online shop. 

The biggest challenge in this project was that the client frequently launched a wide variety of discounts and promotions, many of which were not supported by WooCommerce out of the box. As a result, I had to thoroughly investigate the database structure and plugin code in order to implement advanced custom features. This experience greatly improved my coding abilities. For example, I developed solutions for scenarios such as: buying Product X gives a percentage discount on other products, purchasing a certain quantity entitles the customer to receive the cheapest or most expensive item for free, or other similar complex promotions.

# My Responsibilities

- Handle daily client requests and requirements
- Immediately investigate and fix bugs reported by clients
- Design and implement new features on both the frontend and backend according to client needs
- Offer guidance and support to clients experiencing issues with the system

# Key Contributions

- **Custom Discount Module**
    - Customized the WooCommerce plugin to fulfill complex discount and promotion requirements from clients, including:
      - Buy X, get X% off
      - Shipping adjustments
      - Welcome discounts
      - Referral discounts
    - Ensured correct calculation and accurate application of different types of discounts in the shopping cart, even when multiple discount methods were used together (such as coupon codes, manual discounts, and automatic application).
    - Managed and tested various combinations of discounts to prevent calculation errors.
    - Focused on improving performance, as WordPress can be slow. Optimized and refactored discount logic to ensure the website remained responsive after updates.
    - Through this experience, I greatly improved my coding skills, code reading abilities, and attention to detail.

- **UI & Content Management Improvements**
    - Clients brought in professional designers to create modern, visually appealing layouts tailored to their brand. I meticulously translated these designs into the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring the site's visual presentation matched the intended look and provided an improved user experience. 
    - On the backend, I implemented several dynamic content management solutions so that users could update various site content themselves. Notably, I designed and developed a reusable content update module within WordPress to streamline these updates and ensure long-term maintainability for the company.

- **Performance Improvement**
  - Due to the drawbacks of WordPress, especially when many plugins are installed, the abundance of filters and actions—sometimes added without proper consideration of the overall coding logic—can slow the system down or introduce bugs. I was responsible for reviewing and refactoring the code at different stages to improve both system performance and user experience, ensuring the website remained stable and efficient.
