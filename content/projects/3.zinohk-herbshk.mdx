# Project Background

[zino.hk](https://zino.hk) and [herbs.hk](https://herbs.hk) are the official websites for our client’s company. The design for these websites was provided by the company’s designer, and my role was to implement the websites according to these designs. The client wanted the products displayed on these sites to be connected to their main online store, so I developed APIs within their e-commerce platform to provide product information to both official websites. To make website maintenance easier for their staff, I centralized most of the content management within their online store backend.

# My Responsibilities

- Built both the backend and frontend of the official websites from scratch.
- Developed custom APIs within the online shop so that the official websites could display up-to-date product information directly from the e-commerce platform.
- Integrated the official websites with the main online shop’s APIs, ensuring seamless synchronization of product listings and content.
- Centralized and streamlined content management so that client staff could maintain most content easily through the online shop backend, reducing duplicated work and improving maintainability.
